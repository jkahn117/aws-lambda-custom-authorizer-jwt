# AWS API Gateway Custom Authorizer with JSON Web Token

This project contains a *sample* implementation of an AWS API Gateway Custom Authorizer that makes use of [JSON Web Tokens](http://jwt.io).  The authentication and authorization is very simplistic, but could be enhanced to rely on other systems such as DynamoDB.
